LED Cubes are a common project for those wanting to experience hardware programming first hand.
Unfortunately, building one can take lots of time and money. Our project, aims to provide a
platform for those looking to build and test their code without having to have an actual LED Cube.

Our project has two parts, the first is the simulator which will uses JavaFX and Sockets. A user 
can interface with the server programmatically, via a common interface. This project will also
contain a pre-build client which will be able to program the simulator over `localhost`.

## Documentation
Documentation for our project can be found underneath the `Documentation` folder
